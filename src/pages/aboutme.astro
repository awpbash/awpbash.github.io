    <p>
        My journey began in <strong>civil engineering</strong>, driven by a deep curiosity about how large-scale structures are designed and built. During my pre-university days, I found myself captivated by
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Practical Engineering</a>, diving into the mechanics of soil, concrete, and the principles that make our built environment possible.
        <i><br>Something about digging a 15m wide tunnel for trains 40m below ground level just intrigues me a lot!</br></i>
    </p>

    <p>
        I was fortunate to receive the <strong>NUS Engineering Scholarship</strong>, which enabled me to pursue my undergraduate studies at an accelerated pace. This opportunity not only supported my academic growth but also exposed me to a wide range of interdisciplinary experiences early on.

  <p>
    During my time with CEE, I worked on a research project exploring the use of <strong>recycled tunnel muck</strong>, waste rock from tunneling, as a replacement for sand in concrete. This experience exposed me to the intricate challenges of sustainable construction practices and lab research work which I found both tedious and rewarding. Our findings showed that this substitution was not only feasible, improved the sustainability by reducing carbon footprint, but also reduced Singapore’s dependency on imported sand, strengthening our local supply chain resiliency.

    The project was recognised with several awards, including the <strong>2023 Engineering Innovation Award</strong>, <strong>CDE High Achievement Award</strong>, and the <strong>NUS Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Prize (OURP)</strong>!

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Discovering AI</h2>
      <p>
        As part of my Specialisation in Digitalisation of Urban Infrastructure, I took a course on <strong>Optimization and Algorithms for Civil Engineers</strong> in my second semster of studies. This course introduced me to the world of <strong>AI and digitalization</strong>, where I learned how drones and computer vision can be used to identify cracks and defects on buildings. In this project, we had to design a system that could autonomously fly a drone across multiple points of interests, capture images, and classify the defects, all while ensuring the flight path taken was as short as possible.

      <p>
        Since then, I’ve dived headfirst into the world of <strong>AI</strong>. Whether it's building reinforcement learning agents or hacking together a computer vision prototype, I’m most alive when I’m figuring things out and turning ideas into something real.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Beyond Code</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work and studies, I like to keep my curiosity sharp with a mix of (sometimes painful) hobbies:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>GeoGuessr:</strong> Something about being able to identify where you are just by looking at your surroundings just tickled my brain and I'm greatly amused at how people can pinpoint their location just by looking at the soil and carplates around them. I am currently trying to master the bollard meta!</li>
        <li><strong>Formula 1:</strong> Cars going around in circles may sound boring, but the thrill of racing strategies and team tactics just picks at my brain a lot. I'm an unfortuante Mercedes fan and aspire to be a race strategiest one day!</li>
        <li><strong>League of Legends:</strong> I've been playing this godforsaken game since I was 13 and have a love hates relationship with it. The macro stratgies and micro mechanics are just so intriguing and fun to me but I'm more of an ARAM and URF player where I can just off my brain and autopilot. </li>
