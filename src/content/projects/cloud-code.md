Cloud Code is a LeetCode-style platform that gamifies cloud architecture learning through interactive drag-and-drop challenges, real-time cost estimation, and AI-powered feedback. Built during HackNRoll 2026, a 24-hour hackathon.

## The Problem

Arguably the average aspiring software developer today:

![Comic Strip showing developers confused about cloud architecture](/cloud-code/comic_strip.jpg)

Ever tried understanding cloud architecture but got lost in the theory without practical exposure? So many possible cloud services, how do I even start? Or how do I know what's best out of the many options? What even is in the cloud? That was us too...

## Our Solution

So what better way to learn Cloud Architecture than by feeding our daily desire for gratification through LeetCode-style problems! Through our challenges, users can drag and drop cloud components (e.g. from AWS, Azure, and GCP) to build solutions that are evaluated based on:

- **Functionality**: Does it meet the requirements?
- **Cost Efficiency**: Does it meet the budget constraints?
- **Complexity**: Is it over-engineered or optimally simple?
- **Best Practices**: AI-powered evaluation for security and scalability

For the complete noob, we also provide a simple guided course to bring you from zero to at least something for your first project, or for the working world! And it's risk-free with feedback from our AI evaluators.
